I used the stepper motor and wheels design, along with a new lego car frame to build a moving lego car which runs on the stepper motor.

## Description
Hey again. This time, I used the stepper motor and lego design from the previous test and integrated them into a lego car design. It's a scrappy build made of axles, beams, wheels and gears. 
But I think it's a step forward. It's fun to watch it move forward and backwards like it does. 

## Demo
Here's a demo gif of the car in action:

## Parts used
-Lego technic
-Duct tape and sticky tack
-Stepper motor
-Arduino UNO
-A few wires

## How it works
It works like the last test: Stepper motor turns axle, axle turns gears, and gears turn wheels which makes the car go forward. The wheel at the front was used because it was the easiest wheel to use at the time and also the tallest, making getting the base off the ground much easier.

## Code
The code is the same as the last test, but I'll put it here for reference: [carStepper.ino](carStepper.ino)

## What's next?
Now that I know that a lego car run by a stepper motor can work, I'll try using a servo motor to change the direction in which the car is moving. Might need to take the build apart to do that. It'll be worth it though. This is another step towards my dreams of scoring that Taylor's univeristy scholarship here in Malaysia. Wish me luck!
