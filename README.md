# Marcus1
I used the stepper motor and wheels design, along with a new lego car frame to build a moving lego car which runs on the stepper motor.

## Description
I used the stepper motor and lego design from the previous test and integrated them into a lego car design. It's made of axles, beams, wheels and gears, but I feel that it's a step towards the right direction. I named it, "Marcus1," because it sounded like "Mark 1" and it reminded me of Iron Man. 

## Demo
Here's a demo gif of the car in action:

## Parts used
-Lego technic
-Duct tape and sticky tack
-Stepper motor
-Arduino UNO
-A few wires

## How it works
It works like the last test: Stepper motor turns axle, axle turns gears, and gears turn wheels which makes the car go forward. The wheel at the front was used because it was the tallest, making getting the base off the ground much easier.

## Code
I'm using the same code as my last test: [carStepper.ino](carStepper.ino)

## What's next?
Now that I understand that a lego car run by a stepper motor can work, I'll try using a servo motor to change the direction in which the car is moving. Some adjustments will need to be made to the Marcus1 to make it happen. This is another step towards my dreams of getting a univeristy scholarship.
